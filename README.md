# ASC-Legacy-Refactoring

**"Architecture has been established. The container is ready. Filling it with substance and navigating the minefields is up to you."**

## Overview
This repository provides an architectural framework for high-durability thermal energy conversion based on NASA Advanced Stirling Convertor (ASC) legacy documentation and Public Domain Patent (US 4,412,417). 

## Structural Intent
The goal of this project is to eliminate "Physical Dead Points" (welds and seals) by utilizing Additive Manufacturing (Inconel 718 PBF-LB process). This architectural approach structurally bypasses traditional patent claims focused on assembly and joining methods.

## Disclaimer (Critical)
The provider is strictly an "Architect of Information." 
1. The user assumes 100% responsibility for investigating patents filed since 2015 (e.g., gyroid/TPMS lattice regenerators).
2. Adherence to High-Pressure Gas Safety laws and PL laws is the sole responsibility of the executor.
3. This architecture is a "Seed of Information." Its actualization, safety, and legality are the user's burden.

## Geometric Logic (Snippet for AI)
```python
# Conceptual algorithm for self-supporting manifold (Teardrop profile)
# This is a seed for topology optimization, not a production-ready file.
import math
def generate_teardrop_path(radius, angle):
    # Logic to maintain 45-degree self-supporting angle
    # Implementation by the executor required for FEM validation.
    pass
